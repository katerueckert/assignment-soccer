            LAKE UKICKEE is an American professional soccer club based in Ukickee a suburb of Chikee. The team competes in 
            Major League Soccer (MLS). In 2010 a soccer-specific stadium for the team was approved for Ukickee. However,
            funding for the stadium was still hard to come by. A vote in early 2011 struck down a funding proposal for the stadium.
            However, Sam Boots, the major of Lake Ukickee, said that she would not give up on her fight to approve the proposal in 
            Ukickee. Afterall, the town's name is Ukickee for heaven's sake!
            <br/><br/>
            The funding plan was revised, but was struck down later in 2011 over disagreements in the appropriation of millions of
            hotel-tax dollars for a financially unprove sports franchise. The proposal for Ukickee was declared "dead" by Boots at
            that point, putting the team's future in doubt. Sam Boots said that she wanted the team to remain in Lake Ukickee, but 
            would rescind it if a proposal was not put forward by December 31, 2011.
            <br/><br/>
            Parties from several cities, including Walworth, Wisconsin and Grand Rapids, Michigan, expressed interest in purchasing
            the franchise and moving it. Other stadium sites in the area were also proposed, including the Kickme County Fairgrounds
            in Illinois, and the tiny town of Cleats, just west of Springfield. Finally, on the very day Boots had set as a deadline to 
            have a stadium plan in place or decide to sell the team, and after months of up and down discussions with local
            municipalities, county, and state officials and a change in the funding structure, a tacit agreement between Boots and
            Ukickee, and the County was put in place, and Lake Ukickee announced that they would move forward with the
            construction of Lake Kickme Stadium, which would ultimately be named Boots and Ukickee Stadium.
            <br/><br/>
            The groundbreaking, coinciding with the Basso Cup, which took place that afternoon featuring elected leaders, team 
            officials, as well as the entire rosters of the Lake Ukickee team.
